=========================

Generic CiviCRM extension to enhance tag functionality with start and end dates and coordinator

This extension adds the possibility to add coordinator data to a CiviCRM tag. 

The functional demand at the original customer funding this development is that they need to classify customers in sectors, for example
the logistics sector or the agrarian sector. Within these sectors they should be able to have subsector, like
logistics/frozen transport or agrarian/milk production. CiviCRM tags deliver just that solution.
